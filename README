To run the presentation you will need a webserver and something that can process jade. I am using Express.js, Impress.js and Jade.js.

Installation

Install node.js
Install impress.js

Introduction

Javascript is a wonderful language composed of objects, functions and landmines: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat

While objects and landmines are important. Functions are the very best part of Javascript. They are almost perfect and mostly misunderstood. Today we are talking (mostly) about functions.

If you already understand the brilliance of lexical scope, function scope, hoisting, higher order functions, closures, and curring, you might be in the wrong room.

You can do two things with functions: call them and call them later.

Quiz on calling functions.

Next you need to understand functional scope and lexical scope.

Quiz on both types of scope.

Show the beauty of a well written javascript in a functional style (count_zeroes.js)

If we have time fib.js would be cool to show Y Combinator with caching.
