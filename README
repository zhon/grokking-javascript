Javascript is cool! <Dr Who in a Stetson>

To master javascript, you need to understand functions and objects. Oddly enough, it turns out functions are objects; therefore, your mastery of javascript begins with objects. We will begin with the most importaint object subset: functions.

I realize, some of you are thinking, I don't want mastery, I only want IE bug workarounds to make my unicorns dance over rainbows. To you I say, use Modernizr, "use strict"; attend the HTML5/CSS3 session and get out! I am serious GET OUT!

Now the funny thing about functions is you can call them now or you can call them later (or you can call them not at all).
