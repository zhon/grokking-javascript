To master javascript, you only need to master functions and objects. The rest is simply noise.
To reduce the noise follow "Javascript The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford
(and "use strict";)

Because of time, we are only going to talk about functions.
Now the funny thing about functions is you can call them now or you can call them later (or you can call them not at all).
