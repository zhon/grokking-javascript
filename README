To run the presentation you will need a webserver and something that can process jade. I am using Express.js, Impress.js and Jade.js.


Introduction

Javascript is more than unicorns, rainbows and AJAX callbacks. It is a language that is gaining in popularity and programmers. More people have programed in Javascript than any other language. There might be more lines of javascript code than C and C++. Pretty awesome for a language written in 10 days? You need Javascript on your resume.

Jeff, my javascript hating friend, went in for an interveiw. When asked about javascript, he hated on javascript and threw some love at CoffeeScript. Blam! that was the end of the interveiw.

It is time to take Javascript seriously, already!

Gone (almost) are the days of fighting browser bugs (thank you Modernizer) and stepping on language landmines (thank you Doug). With ECMAScript 5 ("use strict";), JSLint and simplifying your language features:

Javascript is cool! <Dr Who in a Stetson>

Javascript is a wonderful language composed of objects, functions and landmines: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat

While objects and landmines are important. Functions are the very best part of Javascript. They are almost perfect and mostly misunderstood. Today we are talking (mostly) about functions.

If you already understand the brilliance of lexical scope, function scope, hoisting, higher order functions, closures, and curring, you might be in the wrong room.

Lets start with a quiz.

functions are objects


Now the funny thing about functions is you can call them now or you can call them later (or you can call them not at all).

Major Javascript pitfalls
  Dynamic this
  Subtyping is difficult

Minor Javascript pitfalls
  Function-scoped variables
  Inadvertent sharing via closures
  Extracted methods can’t use this
  Creating global variables via this
  Automatic creation of globals
  Comparison via == is weird
  for...in is weird
  Array-like objects
  truthy and falsy values; having both undefined and null
